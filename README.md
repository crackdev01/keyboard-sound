# keyboard-sound
project to turn the keyboard into a piano or drum kit with animation?

This project was just for fun over a weekend. I wanted to play around with canvas 
and make a drum kit of sorts. My daughter got a keyboard and an guitar over christmas, so I wanted to help her learn. This project has since taken a back burner but it is fun for what it is currently.
